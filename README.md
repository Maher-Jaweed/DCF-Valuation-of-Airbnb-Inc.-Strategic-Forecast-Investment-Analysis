# Airbnb Inc. – Strategic Valuation and Market Analysis Summary

This project presents a comprehensive valuation and strategic analysis of Airbnb, Inc., combining financial modeling with competitive and operational insights. The analysis was conducted using SEC filings, market research, and scenario-based forecasting.

Key Highlights:
Three-Statement Model & DCF Valuation:
Built a dynamic financial model forecasting Airbnb’s revenue and earnings over a 5-year horizon using logarithmic growth assumptions across regions. A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was developed to estimate intrinsic value, accounting for unearned revenue recognition and projected stock buybacks.

Strategic Shift Post-IPO:
Identified Airbnb’s evolution from aggressive expansion to a compliance- and quality-focused platform. Key initiatives include Airbnb City Portal, AirCover for Hosts, and regulatory alignment with EU and Japanese frameworks.

Competitive Positioning:
Despite intense competition from Booking.com and Vrbo, Airbnb holds a leading market share in the U.S. and is second in Europe. Differentiators include affordability-focused Airbnb Rooms and host-centric features.

Platform Risks & Mitigation:
Assessed operational risks related to brand reputation, host quality, fraud, and regulatory challenges. Highlighted the company’s use of trust technologies, host standards, and global tax compliance to reduce risk exposure.

Recommendations:
To sustain leadership, continued investment in host support, legal rental supply (Airbnb-Friendly Apartments), and regionally adaptive strategies is advised. The valuation supports a positive long-term outlook if strategic pivots are maintained.
